        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxVivek Ramaswamy on Sunday offered his condolences to Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger's family and Perry's residents. Marburger died earlier in the day, over a week after he was injured in a shooting at the high school.

        In a podcast during the latest Republican debate, Ramaswamy said three armed security guards were needed in each school across the country. As a reporter told Ramaswamy about Marburger’s death Sunday, he changed his stance slightly. One armed security guard could deter, but not stop shootings at schools, Ramaswamy said.
        
        So he would like to see three armed security guards in most schools and up to five armed security guards in larger schools, the Ohio entrepreneur argued.
        
        “We apply more security in our airports, in our banks and many of our shopping malls than we do in our own schools, and I think that’s a failure,” Ramaswamy said. “Our most-valuable national asset is our children and the people taking the effort to educate those children. The least we can do as a country.”

        Nikki Haley: 'Lift up the Perry community in prayer' after Iowa principal dies following shooting
        Haley began her campaign event in Adel, Iowa, asking the crowd to "lift up the Perry community in prayer" after the death of Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger Sunday.
        
        Marburger was shot multiple times during a school shooting earlier this month while trying to distract the 17-year-old shooter, who killed an 11-year-old student and wounded 11 others.
        
        "What happened in Perry, whenever you turn on the TV, it doesn’t matter what state it is, it still hurts," Haley said. "And we still feel it. Our hearts still drop. And today, my heart dropped again when I heard that we lost Dan Marburger. This principal was a hero. He saved lives."
        
        Haley said Marburger's actions are a reminder of the good people who step up in tragic circumstances. She asked the crowd to thank the teachers, the law enforcement officers and other officials who responded to the shooting that day.
        
        "First there’s shock and then there’s sadness and then there’s healing," Haley said. "So as they go through this process, let’s not forget it because it happened one day and went off the TV. Let’s remember that this is going to be a process for them and we need to continue to pray for them."
